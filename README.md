# Connect-Four-Game
Project One Assignment

For project one, I chose the game Connect Four.

Player One plays the black pieces and Player Two plays the red pieces. Player One begins by clicking on column of his/her choice. Pieces automatically move to the lowest available space in the selected column. The object of the game is to connect four of your checkers in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. After a game has been won, the scoreboard is updated. The board is cleared by clicking the new game button.
